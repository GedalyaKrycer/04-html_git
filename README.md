# 04-html_git
Class activity HTML Git

In this class activity I worked on the following items. 

1. Creating a GitHub repository via the SSH connection method. 
2. Creating an `index.html` file within that folder and adding in several html elements. 
    - `<h1>`
    - `<h2>`
    - `<p>`
    - `<img>`
    - `<ul>`
    -  `<a>`
3. Once the html file was created, the new file was then tracked via `git add .` then staged via `git commit -m "Message"` and published to `git push`.
4. As corrections were identified or features added, several more commits were made to the file.
