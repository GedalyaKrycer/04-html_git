# 04-html_git
**Class Activity HTML/Git**

#### In this class activity I worked on the following items

1. Creating a GitHub repository via the SSH connection method. 

2. Creating an `index.html` file within that folder and adding in several html elements.
    - `<h1>`
    - `<h2>`
    - `<p>`
    - `<img>`
    - `<ul>`
    -  `<a>`

3. I also played with the `mailto:` value in the `href=""` attribute, so that the email would open up in an email client.  

4. Once the html file was created, the new file was then tracked via `git add .` then staged via `git commit -m "Message"` and published to `git push`.

5. As corrections were identified or features added, several more commits were made to the file.
